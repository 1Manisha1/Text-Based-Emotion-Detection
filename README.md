# Text-Based-Emotion-Detection
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze textual input and classify emotions. Based on the detected emotion, the system outputs relevant emojis to visually represent the sentiment. It leverages pre-trained models and custom datasets to improve accuracy in emotion detection.
